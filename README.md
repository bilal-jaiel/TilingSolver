# TilingSolver
This research focuses on solving 2D and 3D paving problems, with the aim of exploring different possible tile configurations and assessing their feasibility. The main objectives of the project are to determine the set of possible solutions for a given paving problem, to identify a specific solution or to assess the feasibility of a paving problem.
